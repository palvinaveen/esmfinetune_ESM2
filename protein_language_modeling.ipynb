    "You might wonder why we pass along the `tokenizer` when we already preprocessed our data. This is because we will use it one last time to make all the samples we gather the same length by applying padding, which requires knowing the model's preferences regarding padding (to the left or right? with which token?). The `tokenizer` has a pad method that will do all of this right for us, and the `Trainer` will use it. You can customize this part by defining and passing your own `data_collator` which will receive samples like the dictionaries seen above and will need to return a dictionary of tensors."

We're going to use 0 to indicate residues without any annotated structure, 1 for residues in an alpha helix, and 2 for residues in a beta strand.

Note also that UniProt annotates residues starting from 1 (unlike Python, which starts from 0), and region annotations are inclusive (so 1..3 means residues 1, 2 and 3). To turn these into Python slices, we subtract 1 from the start of each annotation, but not the end."
